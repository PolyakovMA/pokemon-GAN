This project consists of a single Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the creation and training of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is trained on a dataset of Pokémon images and learns to generate new Pokémon characters. 

The notebook covers the following steps:
- Loading and preprocessing the Pokémon dataset
- Defining the Generator and Discriminator networks
- Training the GAN with alternating updates for Generator and Discriminator
- Visualizing generated images during training
- Saving and loading model checkpoints
- Generating new Pokémon images from random noise

The project showcases the process of training a GAN from scratch and highlights common challenges, such as mode collapse and generating diverse images.
